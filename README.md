# Drawing-Board-Godot
This project demonstrates how to draw with mouse on a canvas item using shaders in the Godot game engine. Traditional methods of drawing involve complex, performance-heavy texture operations in GDScript. However, in this project, we use shaders along with texture buffering techniques to create a simple drawing tool. You can use this as a foundation to develop a more sophisticated drawing tool with features like changing colors, erasing, and more.
